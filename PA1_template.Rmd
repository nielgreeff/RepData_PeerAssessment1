###About
This knitr project will read specified data, then answer some questions.

## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
 filename <- "activity_data.zip"
  
  ## Download and unzip the dataset:
  if (!file.exists(filename)){
    getfileURL <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip"
    download.file(getfileURL, filename)
  }  
  if (!file.exists("activity.csv")) { 
    unzip(filename) 
  }

data <- read.csv("activity.csv")

  
```
## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
Aggregate steps per day (date), and plot a histogram of total steps per day and report the mean and median 
```{r}
per_day <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data, sum)

hist(per_day$steps, main = paste("Total Steps Each Day"), col="green", xlab="Number of Steps")
rmean <- mean(per_day$steps)
rmedian <- median(per_day$steps)
```

The `mean` is `r rmean` and the `median` is `r rmedian`.


## What is the average daily activity pattern?
* Calculate average steps for each interval for all days. 
* Plot the Average Number Steps per Day per Interval. 
* Find interval with most average steps. 

```{r}
steps_per_interval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data, mean)

plot(steps_per_interval$interval,steps_per_interval$steps, type="l", xlab="Interval", ylab="Number of Steps",main="Average Number of Steps per Day per Interval")

max_interval <- steps_per_interval[which.max(steps_per_interval$steps),1]
```

The 5-minute interval, on average across all the days, containing the maximum number of steps is `r max_interval`.


## Imputing missing values
We need to replace missing values (NA) in the data.
This is done by calculating the average of the interval and replacing
the missing values with the average for all days.

```{r}
incomplete <- sum(!complete.cases(data))
imputed_data <- transform(data, steps = ifelse(is.na(data$steps), steps_per_interval$steps[match(data$interval, steps_per_interval$interval)], data$steps))
```

Taking special care of 10-01-2012 because it was the first day and would have been over 9,000 steps higher than the following day if we used the averages (next day only has 126 steps). 

The average (and total number of steps) are increasing over the whole period, so starting with zero makes sense
```{r}
imputed_data[as.character(imputed_data$date) == "2012-10-01", 1] <- 0
```

## Re-calculate Histogram and mean and median 
```{r}
new_steps_per_day <- aggregate(steps ~ date, imputed_data, sum)
hist(new_steps_per_day$steps, main = paste("Total Steps Each Day"), col="blue", xlab="Number of Steps")

#Create Histogram to show difference. 
hist(per_day$steps, main = paste("Total Steps Each Day"), col="red", xlab="Number of Steps",add=T)
legend("topright", c("Imputed", "Non-imputed"), col=c("blue", "red"), lwd=10)
```

Calculate new mean and median for imputed data. 
```{r}
new_rmean <- mean(new_steps_per_day$steps)
new_rmedian <- median(new_steps_per_day$steps)

# and also calculate the differences between total steps (corrected and not)
# and means and medians
total_diff <- sum(new_steps_per_day$steps) - sum(per_day$steps)
mean_diff <- new_rmean - rmean
med_diff <- new_rmedian - rmedian

```

#### Differences between imputed and old data
* The imputed data mean is `r new_rmean`
* The imputed data median is `r new_rmedian`
* The difference between the non-imputed mean and imputed mean is `r mean_diff`
* The difference between the non-imputed mean and imputed mean is `r med_diff`
* The difference between total number of steps between imputed and non-imputed data is `r total_diff`.  Thus, there were `r total_diff` more steps in the imputed data.


## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
Also create a plot to show the difference
``` {r}
weekdays <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
imputed_data$dow = as.factor(ifelse(is.element(weekdays(as.Date(imputed_data$date)),weekdays),"Weekday", "Weekend"))

new_steps_per_interval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + dow, imputed_data, mean)

# make sure we can plot by including the lattice library
library(lattice)

xyplot(new_steps_per_interval$steps ~ new_steps_per_interval$interval|new_steps_per_interval$dow, main="Average Steps per Day per Interval",xlab="Interval", ylab="Steps",layout=c(1,2), type="l")

```
